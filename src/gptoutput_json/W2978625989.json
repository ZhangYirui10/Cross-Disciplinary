  "Problem": "Training deep neural networks on noisy labeled datasets often leads to performance degradation due to overfitting on label noise.",
  "Method": "The proposed method uses a meta-learning framework to create noise-tolerant model parameters through synthetic noisy labels and consistent predictions against a teacher model.",
