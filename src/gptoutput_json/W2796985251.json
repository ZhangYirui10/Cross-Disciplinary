  "Problem": "Current methods struggle to accurately parse and analyze humans in crowded scenes, affecting applications like behavior analysis and autonomous driving.",
  "Method": "The paper introduces a Nested Adversarial Network (NAN) that uses a nested structure of GAN-like sub-nets to improve semantic saliency prediction and instance-aware clustering for better parsing.",
