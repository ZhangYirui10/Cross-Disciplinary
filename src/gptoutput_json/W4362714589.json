  "Problem": "Existing machine unlearning methods require access to training data, which is not practical in cases where data is lost or unavailable.",
  "Method": "The paper proposes a zero-shot machine unlearning method that operates without access to original training data, using noise generation to effectively unlearn targeted classes.",
  "Model": "NO",
