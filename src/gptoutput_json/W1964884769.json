  "Problem": "Existing unsupervised co-segmentation methods are ill-defined for groups of related images due to inconsistent backgrounds, requiring user input for effective foreground extraction.",
  "Method": "The paper proposes iCoseg, an interactive co-segmentation algorithm that uses user scribbles to guide an energy minimization framework, intelligently recommending scribble locations for improved segmentation performance.",
  "Model": "iCoseg",
  "Task": "Co-segmentation of foreground objects from groups of related images",
  "Main Results Table": "Figure 6",
  "Results": [
    ["CMU-Cornell iCoseg Dataset", "iCoseg", "Segmentation Accuracy", "Close to upper bound with significantly less effort"],
