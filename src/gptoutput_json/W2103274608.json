  "Problem": "Current methods require explicit color segmentation, which is problematic for complex textured images, hindering accurate separation of diffuse and specular reflections.",
  "Method": "The paper presents a method for separating reflection components based on chromaticity without explicit color segmentation, utilizing intensity logarithmic differentiation and an iterative framework.",
  "Model": "NO",
  "Task": "Separation of diffuse and specular reflection components in textured surfaces using a single image.",
