  "Problem": "The paper addresses the challenge of extracting aspect and opinion terms from user-generated content, which traditional methods struggle to do effectively.",
  "Method": "The proposed RNCRF model combines recursive neural networks and conditional random fields to co-extract aspect and opinion terms by learning discriminative features and propagating information between them.",
