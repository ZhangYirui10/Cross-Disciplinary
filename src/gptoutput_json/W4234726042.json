  "Problem": "Existing differential privacy methods struggle to release high-dimensional data effectively due to noise overpowering signals, rendering published data largely useless.",
  "Method": "PrivBayes constructs a Bayesian network model of the data for low-dimensional marginals, injects noise privately, and samples from the approximate distribution for synthetic data release.",
  "Model": "PrivBayes",
  "Task": "Publishing high-dimensional data while ensuring differential privacy.",
