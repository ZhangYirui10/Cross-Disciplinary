  "Problem": "Current methods struggle with accurate detection and localization of wrist fractures in radiographs, leading to missed diagnoses.",
  "Method": "The study employs an object detection CNN, specifically Inception-ResNet Faster R-CNN, to effectively identify and localize radius and ulna fractures in wrist radiographs.",
  "Model": "Faster R-CNN with Inception-ResNet",
  "Task": "Automated fracture detection and localization on wrist radiographs",
