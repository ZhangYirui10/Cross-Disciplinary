  "Problem": "Current methods primarily focus on fixed strings for authentication, limiting the utility of keystroke dynamics in real-world applications where users type freely.",
  "Method": "The paper explores keystroke dynamics for continuous authentication using a Goodness Measure and two classifiers for identifying users based on free-text sequences.",
  "Model": "NO",
  "Task": "User identification based on keystroke dynamics in a general setting.",
