  "Problem": "Current visual saliency methods primarily focus on 2D scenes, lacking consideration of depth cues which are crucial in 3D environments.",
  "Method": "The study collects a large eye fixation database from 2D and 3D scenes, analyzes discrepancies, and models depth priors to enhance saliency detection models.",
  "Model": "NO",
  "Task": "Visual saliency detection in 3D images",
  "Main Results Table": "Table 1",
