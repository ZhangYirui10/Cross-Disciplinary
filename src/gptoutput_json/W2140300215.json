  "Problem": "Efficient skyline query processing in peer-to-peer networks is challenging due to the need for low overhead, balanced load distribution, and progressive result delivery.",
  "Method": "The paper proposes Skyline Space Partitioning (SSP), which adaptively partitions the query search space and balances the load across peers to enhance skyline query processing efficiency.",
  "Model": "Skyline Space Partitioning (SSP)",
  "Task": "Skyline query processing in distributed environments",
