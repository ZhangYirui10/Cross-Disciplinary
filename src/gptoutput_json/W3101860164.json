  "Problem": "Existing methods for federated learning often fail to securely train models on vertically partitioned data without revealing sensitive information.",
  "Method": "The paper proposes Pivot, a hybrid approach combining threshold partially homomorphic encryption and secure multiparty computation to securely train decision trees and predict outcomes while protecting client data privacy.",
  "Model": "Pivot",
  "Task": "Privacy-preserving vertical federated learning for tree-based models",
