  "Problem": "Current image defogging methods struggle with dense and non-uniform fog, leading to ineffective recovery of background information.",
  "Method": "The paper proposes a structure-representation network combined with uncertainty feedback learning to iteratively enhance defogging results, focusing on dense and non-uniform fog areas.",
