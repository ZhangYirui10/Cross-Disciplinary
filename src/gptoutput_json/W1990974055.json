  "Problem": "Traditional web resource searching strategies are ineffective in Web 2.0 due to the lack of context in user-generated tags, making it challenging to locate relevant geographical resources.",
  "Method": "The paper proposes a tag-centric query processing strategy that uses a new indexing method combining R*-tree and inverted list, and a geo-tf-idf ranking mechanism to locate co-located resources effectively.",
