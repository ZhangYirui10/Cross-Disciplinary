  "Problem": "Current methods exhaustively compute higher-order spatial features, which are computationally expensive and inefficient for object categorization.",
  "Method": "The paper proposes a method that integrates feature selection and extraction, progressively extracting higher-order spatial features based on selected lower-order ones, improving efficiency and accuracy.",
