  "Problem": "Current approaches inadequately protect sensitive information in event sequences occurring over infinite streams, especially when multiple events reveal user privacy.",
  "Method": "The paper introduces w-event privacy, which secures event sequences occurring in successive time instants using a sliding window mechanism and dynamic budget allocation strategies.",
  "Model": "NO",
  "Task": "Statistics publishing with differential privacy over continuous streams",
  "Main Results Table": "Table 3",
