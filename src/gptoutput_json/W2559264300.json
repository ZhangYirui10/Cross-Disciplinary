  "Problem": "Current methods inadequately handle the complex challenges of removing rain from a single image, especially in the presence of heavy rain and rain streak accumulation.",
  "Method": "The paper proposes a recurrent rain detection and removal network that progressively clears rain streaks while incorporating a contextualized dilated network for improved feature extraction.",
  "Model": "Recurrent Joint Rain Detection and Removal Network (JORDER-R)",
  "Task": "Single image rain removal",
  "Main Results Table": "Table 1",
