  "Problem": "Estimating 3D human poses from monocular videos is challenging under varying scales, speeds, and occlusions.",
  "Method": "The paper proposes a spatio-temporal network that integrates multi-scale features and masks out keypoints during training to robustly estimate 3D poses despite occlusions.",
  "Model": "NO",
