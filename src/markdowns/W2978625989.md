# Abstract

Despite the success of deep neural networks (DNNs) in image classification tasks, the human-level performance relies on massive training data with high-quality manual annotations, which are expensive and time-consuming to collect. There exist many inexpensive data sources on the web, but they tend to contain inaccurate labels. Training on noisy labeled datasets causes performance degradation because DNNs can easily overfit to the label noise. To overcome this problem, we propose a noise-tolerant training algorithm, where a meta-learning update is performed prior to conventional gradient update. The proposed meta-learning method simulates actual training by generating synthetic noisy labels, and trains the model such that after one gradient update using each set of synthetic noisy labels, the model does not overfit to the specific noise. We conduct extensive experiments on the noisy CIFAR-10 dataset and the Clothing1M dataset. The results demonstrate the advantageous performance of the proposed method compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

# 1. Introduction

One of the key reasons why deep neural networks (DNNs) have been so successful in image classification is the collections of massive labeled datasets such as COCO and ImageNet. However, it is time-consuming and expensive to collect such high-quality manual annotations. A single image often requires agreement from multiple annotators to reduce label error. On the other hand, there exist other less expensive sources to collect labeled data, such as search engines, social media websites, or reducing the number of annotators per image. However, those low-cost approaches introduce low-quality annotations with label noise. Many studies have shown that label noise can significantly affect the accuracy of the learned classifiers. In this work, we address the following problem: how to effectively train on noisy labeled datasets?

Some methods learn with label noise by relying on human supervision to verify seed images or estimate the label confusion. However, those methods exhibit a disadvantage in scalability for large datasets. On the other hand, methods without human supervision (e.g. label correction and noise correction layers) are scalable but less effective and more heuristic. In this work, we propose a meta-learning based noise-tolerant (MLNT) training to learn from noisy labeled data without human supervision or access to any clean labels. Rather than designing a specific model, we propose a model-agnostic training algorithm, which is applicable to any model that is trained with gradient-based learning rule.

The prominent issue in training DNNs on noisy labeled data is that DNNs often overfit to the noise, which leads to performance degradation. Our method addresses this issue by optimizing for a model’s parameters that are less prone to overfitting and more robust against label noise. Specifically, for each mini-batch, we propose a meta-objective to train the model, such that after the model goes through conventional gradient update, it does not overfit to the label noise. The proposed meta-objective encourages the model to produce consistent predictions after it is trained on a variety of synthetic noisy labels. The key idea of our method is: a noise-tolerant model should be able to consistently learn the underlying knowledge from data despite different label noise. The main contribution of this work are as follows.

- We propose a noise-tolerant training algorithm, where a meta-objective is optimized before conventional training. Our method can be theoretically applied to any model trained with gradient-based rule. We aim to optimize for a model that does not overfit to a wide spectrum of artificially generated label noise.
- We formulate our meta-objective as: train the model such that after it learns from various synthetic noisy labels using gradient update, the updated models give consistent predictions with a teacher model. We adapt a self-ensembling method to construct the teacher model, which gives more reliable predictions unaffected by the synthetic noise.
- We perform experiments on two datasets with synthetic and real-world label noise, and demonstrate the advantageous performance of the proposed method compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

advantageous performance of the proposed method in image classification tasks compared to state-of-the-art methods. In addition, we conduct extensive ablation study to examine different components of the proposed method. Our code is publicly available1.

# 2. Related Work

Learning with label noise. A number of approaches have been proposed to train DNNs with noisy labeled data. One line of approaches formulate explicit or implicit noise models to characterize the distribution of noisy and true labels, using neural networks [5, 8, 11, 19, 16, 23, 29], directed graphical models [31], knowledge graphs [13], or conditional random fields [27]. The noise models are then used to infer the true labels or assign smaller weights to noisy samples. However, these methods often require a small set of data with clean labels to be available, or use expensive estimation methods. They also rely on specific assumptions about the noise model, which may limit their effectiveness with complicated label noise. Another line of approaches use correction methods to reduce the influence of noisy labels. Bootstrap method [18] introduces a consistency objective that effectively re-labels the data during training. Tanaka et al. [24] propose to jointly optimize network parameters and data labels. An iterative training method is proposed to identify and downweight noisy samples [30]. A few other methods have also been proposed that use noise-tolerant loss functions to achieve robust learning under label noise [3, 4, 28].

Meta-Learning. Recently, meta-learning methods for DNNs have resurged in its popularity. Meta-learning generally seeks to perform the learning at a level higher than where conventional learning occurs, e.g. learning the update rule of a learner [17], or finding weight initializations that can be easily fine-tuned [1] or transferred [12]. Our approach is most related to MAML [1], which aims to train model parameters that can learn well based on a few examples and a few gradient descent steps. Both MAML and our method are model-agnostic and perform training by doing gradient updates on simulated meta-tasks. However, our objective and algorithm are different from that of MAML. MAML addresses few-shot transfer to new tasks, whereas we aim to learn a noise-tolerant model. Moreover, MAML trains using classification loss on a meta-test set, whereas we use a consistency loss with a teacher model.

# 3. Method

# 3.1. Problem Statement

We consider a classification problem with a training set D = {(x1,y1), ...,(xn,yn)}, where xi denotes the ith sample and yi ∈ {0, 1}c is a one-hot vector representing the corresponding noisy label over c classes. Let f(xi, θ) denote the discriminative function of a neural network parameterized by θ, which maps an input to an output of the c-class softmax layer. The conventional objective for supervised classification is to minimize an empirical risk, such as the cross entropy loss:

Lc = -1/n ∑i=1n yi · log(f(xi,θ)),

where · denotes dot product.

However, since yi contains noise, the neural network can overfit and perform poorly on the test set. We propose a meta-objective that encourages the network to learn noise-tolerant parameters. The details are delineated next.

# 3.2. Meta-Learning based Noise-Tolerant Training

Our method can learn the parameters of a DNN model in such a way as to “prepare” the model for label noise. The intuition behind our method is that when training with a

# Figure 2

Illustration of the proposed meta-learning based noise-tolerant (MLNT) training. For each mini-batch of training data, a meta loss is minimized before training on the conventional classification loss. We first generate multiple mini-batches of synthetic noisy labels with random neighbor label transfer (marked by orange arrow). The random neighbor label transfer can preserve the underlying noise transition (e.g. DEER → HORSE, CAT ↔ DOG), therefore generating synthetic label noise in a similar distribution as the original data. For each synthetic mini-batch, we update the parameters with gradient descent, and enforce the updated model to give consistent predictions with a teacher model. The meta-objective is to minimize the consistency loss across all updated models w.r.t θ.

Gradient-based rule, some network parameters are more tolerant to label noise than others. How can we encourage the emergence of such noise-tolerant parameters? We achieve this by introducing a meta-learning update before the conventional update for each mini-batch. The meta-learning update simulates the process of training with label noise and makes the network less prone to over-fitting. Specifically, for each mini-batch of training data, we generate a variety of synthetic noisy labels on the same images. With each set of synthetic noisy labels, we update the network parameters using one gradient update, and enforce the updated network to give consistent predictions with a teacher model unaffected by the synthetic noise. As shown in Figure 1, the meta-learning update optimizes the model so that it can learn better with conventional gradient update on the original mini-batch. In effect, we aim to find model parameters that are less sensitive to label noise and can consistently learn the underlying knowledge from data despite label noise.

The proposed meta-learning update consists of two procedures: meta-train and meta-test.

# Meta-Train

Formally, at each training step, we consider a mini-batch of data (X, Y) sampled from the training set, where X = {x1, ...,xk} are k samples, and Y = {y1, ...,yk} are the corresponding noisy labels. We want to generate multiple mini-batches of noisy labels {Y1, ...,YM} with similar label noise distribution as Y. We will describe the procedure for generating one set of synthetic noisy labels.

# Meta-Test

Our meta-objective is to train θ such that each updated parameters θ′ do not overfit to the specific noisy labels ˆY m. We achieve this by enforcing each updated model to give consistent predictions with a teacher model. We consider the model parameterized by θ as the...

# Algorithm 1 Meta-Learning based Noise-Tolerant Training

1. Randomly initialize θ
2. Initialize teacher model ˜θ
3. while not done do
4. Sample a mini-batch (X, Y) of size k from D.
5. 1. for m = 1 : M do
2. Generate synthetic noisy labels Ym by random neighbor label transfer
3. Compute updated parameters with gradient descent: θ′ = θ − α∇Lc(X, Ym, θ)
4. Evaluate consistency loss with teacher:
5. J(θ′) = 1/k ∑i=1k DKL(f(xi, θ) || f(xi, θ′))
6. end for
6. Evaluate Lmeta(θ) = 1/M ∑m=1M J(θ′m)
7. Meta-learning update θ ← θ − η∇Lmeta(θ)
8. Evaluate classification loss Lc(X, Y, θ)
9. Update θ ← θ − β∇Lc(X, Y, θ)
10. Update teacher model: ˜θ = γθ + (1 − γ)θ
11. end while

Note that the meta-gradient ∇Lmeta(θ) involves a gradient through a gradient, which requires calculating the second-order derivatives with respect to θ. In our experiments, we use a first-order approximation by omitting the second-order derivatives, which can significantly increase the computation speed. The comparison in Section 4.4 shows that this approximation performs almost as well as using second-order derivatives. This provides another intuition to explain our method: The first-order approximation considers the term α∇Lc(X, Ym, θ) in equation 7 as a constant. Therefore, we can consider the update θ − α∇Lc(X, Ym, θ) as injecting data-dependent noise to the parameters, and adding noise to the network during training has been shown by many studies to have a regularization effect [10, 22].

# 3.3. Iterative Training

We propose an iterative training scheme for two purposes: (1) Remove samples with potentially wrong class labels from the classification loss Lc(X, Y, θ). (2) Improve the predictions from the teacher model f(xi, ˜θ) so that the consistency loss is more effective.

First, we perform an initial training iteration following the method described in Algorithm 1, and acquire a model with the best validation accuracy (usually the teacher). We name that model as mentor and use θ* to denote its parameters. In the second training iteration, we repeat the steps in Algorithm 1 with two changes described as follows. First, if the classification loss Lc(X, Y, θ) is applied to the entire training set D, samples with wrong ground-truth labels can corrupt training. Therefore, we remove a sample.

ple from the classification loss if the mentor model assigns a low probability to the ground-truth class. In effect, the classification loss would now sample batches from a filtered training set D′ which contains fewer corrupted samples.

D′ = {(xi,yi) ∈ D | yi · f(xi,θ∗) > τ},

where f(xi,θ∗) is the softmax prediction of the mentor model, and τ is a threshold to control the balance between the quality and quantity of D′.

Second, we improve the effectiveness of the consistency loss by merging the predictions from the mentor model and the teacher model to produce more reliable predictions. The new consistency loss is:

k

J′(θ′) = 1 ∑ DKL(s||f(xi,θ′)),

m k i=1 m

s = λf(xi,θ∗) + (1 − λ)f(xi,θ),

where λ is a weight to control the importance of the teacher model and the mentor model. It is ramped up from 0 to 0.5 as training proceeds.

We train for three iterations in our experiments. The mentor model is the best model from the previous iteration. We observe that further training iterations beyond three do not give noticeable performance improvement.

# 4. Experiments

# 4.1. Datasets

We conduct experiments on two datasets, namely CIFAR-10 [9] and Clothing1M [31]. We follow the same experimental setting as previous studies [16, 24, 27] for fair comparison.

For CIFAR-10, we split 10% of the training data for validation, and artificially corrupt the rest of the training data with two types of label noise: symmetric and asymmetric. The symmetric label noise is injected by using a random one-hot vector to replace the ground-truth label of a sample with a probability of r. The asymmetric label noise is designed to mimic some of the structure of real mistakes for similar classes [16]: TRUCK → AUTOMOBILE, BIRD → AIRPLANE, DEER → HORSE, CAT ↔ DOG. Label transitions are parameterized by r ∈ [0,1] such that true class and wrong class have probability of 1 − r and r, respectively.

Clothing1M [31] consists of 1M images collected from online shopping websites, which are classified into 14 classes, e.g. t-shirt, sweater, jacket. The labels are generated using surrounding texts provided by sellers, which contain real-world errors. We use the 14k and 10k clean data for validation and test, respectively, but we do not use the 50k clean training data.

# 4.2. Implementation

For experiments on CIFAR-10, we follow the same experimental setting as [24] and use the network based on Pre-Act ResNet-32 [7]. By common practice [24], we normalize the images, and perform data augmentation by random horizontal flip and 32 × 32 random cropping after padding 4 pixels per side. We use a batch size k = 128, a step size α = 0.2, a learning rate β = 0.2, and update θ using SGD with a momentum of 0.9 and a weight decay of 10−4. For each training iteration, we divide the learning rate by 10 after 80 epochs, and train until 120 epochs. For the initial iteration, we ramp up η (meta-learning rate) from 0 to 0.4 during the first 20 epochs, and keep η = 0.4 for the rest of the training. In terms of the EMA decay γ, we use γ = 0.99 for the first 20 epochs and γ = 0.999 later on, because the student improves quickly early in the training, and thus the teacher should have a shorter memory [25]. In the ablation study (Section 4.4), we will show the effect of the three important hyper-parameters, namely M, the number of synthetic mini-batches, ρ, the number of samples with label replacement, and the threshold τ for data filtering. The value for all hyper-parameters are determined via validation.

For experiments on Clothing1M, we follow previous works [16, 24] and use the ResNet-50 [6] pre-trained on ImageNet. For preprocessing, we resize the image to 256 × 256, crop the middle 224 × 224 as input, and perform normalization. We use a batch size k = 32, a step size α = 0.02, a learning rate β = 0.0008, and update θ using SGD with a momentum of 0.9 and a weight decay of 10−3. We train for 3 epochs for each iteration. During the first 2000 mini-batches in the initial iteration, we ramp up η from 0 to 0.0008, and set γ = 0.99. For the rest of the training, we use η = 0.0008 and γ = 0.999. Other hyper-parameters are set as M = 10, ρ = 0.5k, and τ = 0.3.

# 4.3. Experiments on CIFAR-10

We compare the proposed MLNT with multiple baseline methods using CIFAR-10 dataset with symmetric label noise (noise ratio r = 0,0.1,0.3,0.5, 0.7, 0.9) and asymmetric label noise (noise ratio r = 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4,0.5). The baselines include:

1. Cross Entropy: conventional training without the meta-learning update. We report both the results from [24] and from our own implementation.
2. Forward [16]: forward loss correction based on the noise transition matrix.
3. CNN-CRF [27]: a CRF model is proposed to represent the relationship between noisy and clean labels. It requires a small set of clean labels during training.
4. Joint Optimization [24]: alternatively updates network parameters and corrects labels during training.

Both Forward [16] and CNN-CRF [27] require the ground-truth noise transition matrix, and Joint Optimization...

tion [24] requires the ground-truth class distribution among training data. Our method does not require any prior knowledge on the data, thus is more general. Note that all baselines use the same network architecture as our method. We report the numbers published in [24].

Table 1 and Table 2 show the results for symmetric and asymmetric label noise, respectively. Our implementation of Cross Entropy has lower overall accuracy compared to [24]. The reason could be the different programming frameworks used (we use PyTorch [15], whereas [24] used Chainer [26]). For both types of noise, the proposed MLNT method with one training iteration significantly improves accuracy compared to Cross Entropy (reproduced), and achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art methods. Iterative training further improves the performance. MLNT-teacher after three iterations significantly outperforms previous methods. An exception where MLNT does not outperform baselines is with 50% asymmetric label noise. This is because that asymmetric label noise is generated by exchanging CAT and DOG classes, and it is theoretically impossible to distinguish them without prior knowledge when the noise ratio is 50%.

At the 80th epoch, the learning rate is divided by 10, which

causes a drastic increase in both training and test accuracy for MLNT-student and Cross Entropy. After the 80th epoch, the model begins to overfit because of the small learning rate. However, the proposed MLNT-student suffers less overfitting compared to Cross Entropy, as shown by its lower training accuracy and higher test accuracy.

# Hyper-parameters.

We conduct ablation study to examine the effect of three hyper-parameters: M, ρ, τ. M is the number of mini-batches {(X, ˆY m)}m=1 with synthetic noisy labels that we generate for each mini-batch (X, Y) from the original training data. Intuitively, with larger M, the model is exposed to a wider variety of label noise, and thus can learn to be more noise-tolerant. In Figure 4 we show the test accuracy on CIFAR-10 for MLNT-student (1st iter.) with M = 0, 5, 10, 15 (M = 0 is the same as Cross Entropy) trained using labels with symmetric noise (SN) and asymmetric noise (AN) of different ratio. The result shows that the accuracy indeed increases as M increases. The increase is most significant when M changes from 0 to 5, and is marginal when M changes from 10 to 15. Therefore, the experiments in this paper are conducted using M = 10, as a trade-off between the training speed and the model’s performance.

ρ is the number of samples whose labels are changed in each synthetic mini-batch ˆY m of size k. We experiment with ρ = 0.1k, 0.2k, 0.3k, 0.4k, 0.5k, which correspond to 13, 26, 39, 51, 64 samples with a batch size of 128. Figure 5 shows the performance of MLNT-student (1st iter.) using different ρ trained on CIFAR-10 with different ratio of asymmetric label noise. The performance is insensitive to the value of ρ. For different noise ratio, the optimal ρ generally falls into the range of [0.3k, 0.5k]. τ is the threshold to determine which samples are filtered out by the mentor model during the 2nd and 3rd training iteration. It controls the balance between the quality and quantity of the data that is used by the classification loss.

# 5. Conclusion

In this paper, we propose a meta-learning method to learn from noisy labeled data, where a meta-learning update is performed prior to conventional gradient update. The proposed meta-objective aims to find noise-tolerant model parameters that are less prone to overfitting. In the meta-train step, we generate multiple mini-batches with synthetic noisy labels, and use them to update the parameters. In the meta-test step, we apply a consistency loss between each updated model and a teacher model, and train the original parameters to minimize the total consistency loss. In addition, we propose an iterative training scheme, where the model from previous iteration is used to clean data and refine predictions. We evaluate the proposed method on two datasets. The results validate the advantageous performance of our method compared to state-of-the-art methods. For future work, we plan to explore using the proposed model-agnostic method to other domains with different model architectures, such as learning Recurrent Neural Networks for machine translation with corrupted ground-truth sentences.
